		<h2>
			Discovering Divastra: Unveiling the Divine Weapon Crafted by Prabhat Ranjan
		</h2>
		<p>
			Divastra, a portmanteau of "Divya" meaning divine and "Astra" meaning weapon, embodies the visionary
			creation of Prabhat Ranjan to tackle contemporary challenges with modern solutions. Initially conceived as a
			COVID-19 fighter tool, Divastra swiftly evolved into a multifaceted platform aimed at combating illiteracy
			and empowering students, particularly IIT JEE aspirants and engineering college students, with essential
			resources and guidance for academic and career excellence.
		</p>
		<h4>
			Origins of Divastra:
		</h4>
		<p>
			The genesis of Divastra stems from the urgent need to address the global COVID-19 pandemic. Prabhat Ranjan,
			recognizing the necessity for innovative solutions, conceptualized Divastra as a comprehensive toolkit
			encompassing a COVID tracker, analytics, aid, and more. However, its purpose transcended beyond pandemic
